## About me!

I’m Niels, a second-year Computer Science student from the Netherlands with a passion for programming and technology! I’m always excited to experiment with new tools and technologies.

My journey in software development is driven by a love for problem-solving and a curiosity to learn new things. I also have a special place in my heart for Neovim, my go-to tool for writing code.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy working on my (open-source) projects, learning about emerging trends, and challenging myself to think outside the box.
